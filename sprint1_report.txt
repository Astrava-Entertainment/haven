Sprint 1 Report
Date: Tue Jul 8 02:29:51 UTC 2025

Changes:
- Added Haven CLI initialization logic to create `.haven` workspace with objects and metadata directories.
- Generated a configuration file with a unique identifier and detected installed game engines.
- Initialized a Git repository and ensured the `trunk` branch exists.
- Implemented a simple FUSE simulation message.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude the `.haven/` directory.

Testing instructions:
1. Build the CLI with `cargo build --package haven_cli`.
2. Run `cargo run --package haven_cli -- init` in a clean directory.
3. Verify that `.haven/` is created with `objects/`, `metadata/`, and `config.toml`.
4. Check `.gitignore` for the `.haven/` entry.
5. Inspect console output for engine detection and FUSE simulation messages.
